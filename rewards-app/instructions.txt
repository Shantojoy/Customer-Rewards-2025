Rewards Points System Setup Guide
=================================

1. Import the database schema
   - Create a MySQL user with permissions to create databases and tables.
   - Run the commands in `database/schema.sql` against your MySQL server to create the `rewards_system` database and tables, and to insert the default administrator account.

2. Configure database credentials
   - Open `config.php` and update the `$dbHost`, `$dbUser`, `$dbPass`, and `$dbName` variables so they match your MySQL environment.
   - The application expects the database name to be `rewards_system` unless you change it in the configuration file.

3. Default login credentials
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - These credentials map to the default superadmin user created by the schema script.

4. Security recommendations
   - Change the default administrator password immediately after the first login from the admin dashboard.
   - Create separate accounts for cashiers with the `cashier` role if you need to restrict permissions.

5. Running the application
   - Deploy the contents of the `rewards-app` folder to a PHP-enabled web server with access to the configured MySQL database.
   - Ensure the server can write to the database and that PHP sessions are enabled.
   - Access `/login.php` for the administrator dashboard and `/index.php` for the customer-facing kiosk display.
